## Background

- Find 4-5 examples of different data visualizations used to answer specific questions
- List 2-3 items that are unique or good
- Identify 1 issue with each example

## Data Wrangling



## Data Visualization



1. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/

This article shows the projection for the 2020 Democratic Nomination. There are many graphs and tables that are shown within the document but that doesn't add to the complexity or readability of the article. For this assignment we'll discuss the first two graphs that show the overall prediction. The second graph is very easy to read and is very fluid, it shows us who is projected to win the state according to the date and how that adds or subtracts from the probability of winning the nomination. I like how it's color coded and also has visuals for each candidate, this really adds to the fluidity of the graph. The first graph shows us how many delegates the candidates will win by taking the state. This graph not only shows it in a time plot but also in a bar chart, this a really user friendly graph and something I like. I do see an issue for the first graph. You can't really see the range of the average behind the time graph. Because of this you don't have a complete understanding of the ranges.

2. https://priceonomics.com/5g-is-200x-faster-and-will-unlock-everything-heres/

This article shows us the comparison of 5G and LTE speeds, latency, and expected device proliferation. The first 4 graphs are very basic and easily portray how much better 5G is and how much of a boom will it cause. I'm more interested in the reasons companies want to adopt 5G technology graph and the 5G adoption rate by countries. Both of these are very easy to read and both use a bar chart to display the data, I really like the minimalist approach to these graphs. It's good for the readability between any consumer. I also adoption rate by countries because it not only shows the rate for this year but it actually shows the rate for the past 2 years. This is great to show the depth and and complexity of the data in a easy format. What I don't like is that the reasons to adopt graphic does not show the amount of companies surveyed, so in retrospect it could've been 30 companies or 300 companies. I would've liked more background information for the graphic.

3. https://priceonomics.com/what-are-the-most-popular-discontinued-cars/

This article protrays what the most popular dicontinued vehicles are for sales. Lets start with the bad of this article. They used a pie chart to display what the most popular discontinued vehicle types were. Not only is the pie chart a very bad graphic but it also doesn't explain what they consider for each vehicle type. For example, what would be considered a luxury vehicle in their graphic? What I do like is that all there graphics are dynamic. I'd really love to implement that more often in my own visualizations. What I also liked, which is becoming a theme here, is it's minimalistic graphs. It really helps with ease of access to any user.

4. https://priceonomics.com/survey-which-data-skills-do-you-need-to-get-ahead/

This article seemed pretty relevant to our class and even our fields. It's about what data skills you'll need to be successful in the next 10 years. I think the first graphs title was pretty misleading for what it portrayed. It asks how valuable data is important to thd organizations success, it then collected data for what areas in their workplace it's valube for. By reading the title I would've thought that it would've shown, "Very important, important, somewhat, not at all". The last graph is a time graph that shows the increase in data jobs that were posted. I really like this graphic and think it's very suitable for this article and its conclusion. I like how there's no unneccessary things on the graphic, it's very straightforeward. I really like how they have very specific questions that are answered by the graphs, it's not very broad questions. For example, one of the graphics is entitled "I Need Data Skills to Get Promoted in My Organization". This is very specific and also a great question the encases the whole article.


## Conclusions

Through this assignment of researching different articles with different graphics made me come up with a few conclusions. One really major thing I realized is that keeping your graph as simple and minimal as possible is one of the greatest things you can do. This really helps with the readability from the users and also just makes the whole thing look nice. I also realized that your questions that you answer from the graph need to be very specific and not broad. This will help with the interpretation of the graph.
